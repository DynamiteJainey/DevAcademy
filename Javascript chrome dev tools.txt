JAVASCRIPT CHROME DEV TOOLS

These are a set of tools built into the browser to aid frontend developers diagnose and solve various issues in their applications — such as JavaScript and logical bugs, CSS styling issues or even just making quick temporary alterations to the DOM.

To enter the dev tools, 

right click and click Inspect (or press ctrl+shift+c/cmd+opt+c) to enter the Elements panel. 

Here you can debug CSS and HTML issues. 


If you want to see logged messages or interact with javascript, enter the Console tab from the tabs above (or press ctrl+shift+j or F12 /cmd+opt+j to enter it directly). 


Another very useful feature in the Chrome dev tools is the Lighthouse (for checking performance).

NOTE: This isn’t a chrome-specific feature, and most browsers (Chromium based or otherwise) will have their own, largely-similar set of devtools.




Debugging issues
When you’re just starting out with JavaScript development, you might use a lot of console.log() statement in your code to log and check values of variables while debugging. 


The results of these would show up in the Console panel, along with a reference to the line and file of code which originated it.

However, for quicker, more complex and easier to handler debugging (which also doesn’t litter your codebase with console.log()s), breakpoints and the sources panel is your friend.
