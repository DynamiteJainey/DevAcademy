/* Instance methods on objects can access instance variables and this.

// Getters and setters are special methods that provide read and 
// write access to an objectâ€™s properties. Recall that each instance 
// variable has an implicit getter, plus a setter if appropriate. You 
// can create additional properties by implementing getters and setters, 
// using the get and set keywords:
class Rectangle {
  double left, top, width, height;

  Rectangle(this.left, this.top, this.width, this.height);

  // Define two calculated properties: right and bottom.
  double get right => left + width;
  set right(double value) => left = value - width;
  double get bottom => top + height;
  set bottom(double value) => top = value - height;
}

// Instance, getter, and setter methods can be abstract, defining an interface 
// but leaving its implementation up to other classes. Abstract methods can only 
// exist in abstract classes.

// To make a method abstract, use a semicolon (;) instead of a method body:
abstract class Doer {
  // Define instance variables and methods...

  void doSomething(); // Define an abstract method.
}

class EffectiveDoer extends Doer {
  void doSomething() {
    // Provide an implementation, so the method is not abstract here...
  }
